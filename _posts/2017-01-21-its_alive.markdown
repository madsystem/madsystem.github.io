Dear passenger: Welcome. 

This is my n'th try to keep an online presence up and alive. 
Main focus will be programming / dev related topics (I guess) and if I have time
ill also try to blog.

This time i'll use [jekyll-gh]Jekyll with the [swiss]swiss theme. For my cv page I use [cv-gh] online-cv.
Thanks to the creators for creating something fancy in an easy manner.

[cv-gh]: https://github.com/sharu725/online-cv
